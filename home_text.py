\nThis is a RESTful API designed to help manage a fictitious casting agency and uses Auth0 authentication to provide role based access to its various endpoints.
\nDue to the lack of authentication on the frontend, this API must be tested using the Postman test suite included in the Github repository at https://github.com/tylerpWebDev/FSND.
\nA list of all endpoints can be found in the ReadMe file or within the Postman testing suite."""
